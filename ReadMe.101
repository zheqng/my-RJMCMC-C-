PWCheck - Check the existence of passwords

While doing a security review I stumbled into the necessity to find
out, if all users do have a password set.
Knowing the structure of USERID and LUSERID allowed me to check
this, but not every security administrator has this information.

So I decided to write a small tool, that checks all user entries and
displays those, NOT having a password.

To successfully run the tool, you MUST be logged on to SUPER.SUPER, or
use a PROGIDed version of PWCHECK.


The command syntax is:


  [run] PWCHECK [/OUT <file>/] [-HELP]

where

  <file>   is the OUT file to which RESETSFC has to send to.
           In case this is a non existant disk file, it becomes created
           as an EDIT type file.

  -HELP    causes ResetSFC to display a help screen

e.g.

$GHS1 PWCHECK 9>   pwcheck
PWCheck (110) - T7172G06 - (22Aug2006) System \BEECH, running NSK G06
